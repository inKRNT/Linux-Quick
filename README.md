# Linux-Quick
Simple but useful addons for Linux Based operating systems 
## Examples
If you code in c++ and think x86_64mingw-64-g++ is to long just to build for windows, then wg++ and wgcc is god option for you \
ok what about windows? want to use these on windows well its possible I have made a few things that work like sudo and vim or emacs( both need some extra steps ) \
or maybe you dont like running dir instead of ls? try it!
## install
this is so easy if you can't do this please become amish instead. go to release download the windows version or linux depending on your pc.
### Windows
 extract to documents or any place you want and add it to PATH
 ### Linux
